v1
BLACK AND WHITE 
- everything is about luminescence there is no hue
- no expectation of color bleeding due to refraction (no natural ...)

* means v2 or later

types of rays used for rendering
- [ray0] direct eye through pixel ray to determine what the camera is looking at
- [ray1] from ray0's destination, draw a ray to the light source
----- for shadowing, value will either be 0 or 1 (can it reach the light source)
- *[ray2] color bleeding (from destination to nearby objects)
- [ray3] reflection (draw ray at angle of incidence)
- *[ray4] refraction (drawing rays through destination object to start a new ray chain)
- *[ray5] INTERNAL REFLECTION (Sanjana insists refraction inside object has a special name)


hints:
- single ray can hint at other ray values due to locality



flow for drawing:
    draw ray0 (x1)
        source: camera position, angle determined by pixel location on screen 
        destination: first surface that ray hits
    draw ray1 (xN | N = number of light sources)
        source: ray0 destination
        destination: each light source 
    draw ray3 (x1)
        source: ray0 destination
        destination: (angle of incidence)
        ** this means ray3 spawns its own ray1s

        
        
Initial 

<foo()>

test:
    1) get parameters
    2) result = foo(params)
    3) get EXPECTED results (from file)
    4) assert(result == EXPECTED)


Milestone 1
    single sphere, single light source, static camera 
        MEASURE: correct shadowing on the sphere
